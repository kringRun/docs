## Self-hosted considerations

For self-hosted LangSmith installations:

- Ensure you're running a supported version to receive security updates
- Plan regular upgrades to maintain support
- Monitor [Helm chart releases](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-helm-charts/releases) for updates
- Follow the [self-hosted upgrade guide](/langsmith/self-host-upgrades) for detailed instructions

## Current version support

To check the current supported versions and their support levels, refer to the [LangSmith changelog](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith/releases) for the latest release information.
