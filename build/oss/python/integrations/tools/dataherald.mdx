title: Dataherald

This notebook goes over how to use the dataherald component.

First, you need to set up your Dataherald account and get your API KEY:

1. Go to dataherald and sign up [here](https://www.dataherald.com/)
2. Once you are logged in your Admin Console, create an API KEY
3. pip install dataherald

Then we will need to set some environment variables:

1. Save your API KEY into DATAHERALD_API_KEY env variable

```python
pip install dataherald
%pip install -qU langchain-community
```

```python
import os

os.environ["DATAHERALD_API_KEY"] = ""
```

```python
from langchain_community.utilities.dataherald import DataheraldAPIWrapper
```

```python
dataherald = DataheraldAPIWrapper(db_connection_id="65fb766367dd22c99ce1a12d")
```

```python
dataherald.run("How many employees are in the company?")
```

```output
'select COUNT(*) from employees'
```
