# LLMs

<Warning>
**You are currently on a page documenting the use of [text completion models](/oss/python/concepts/text_llms). Many of the latest and most popular models are [chat completion models](/oss/python/langchain/models).**


Unless you are specifically using more advanced prompting techniques, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/oss/python/integrations/chat/).
</Warning>

[LLMs](/oss/python/concepts/text_llms) are language models that take a string as input and return a string as output.

<Info>
**If you'd like to write your own LLM, see [this how-to](/oss/python/how-to/custom_llm/).**

If you'd like to contribute an integration, see [Contributing integrations](/oss/python/contributing#add-a-new-integration).
