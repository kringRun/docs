[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is an open source reference management system intended for managing bibliographic data and related research materials. You can connect to your personal library, as well as shared group libraries, via the [API](https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/web_api/v3/start). This retriever implementation utilizes [PyZotero](https://github.com/urschrei/pyzotero) to access libraries.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pyzotero
```

## Retriever

See a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/retrievers/zotero).

```python
from langchain_zotero_retriever.retrievers import ZoteroRetriever
```
