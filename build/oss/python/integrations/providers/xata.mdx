title: Xata
---

> [Xata](https://xata.io) is a serverless data platform, based on `PostgreSQL`.
> It provides a Python SDK for interacting with your database, and a UI
> for managing your data.
> `Xata` has a native vector type, which can be added to any table, and
> supports similarity search. LangChain inserts vectors directly to `Xata`,
> and queries it for the nearest neighbors of a given vector, so that you can
> use all the LangChain Embeddings integrations with `Xata`.


## Installation and Setup


We need to install `xata` python package.

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install xata==1.0.0a7
```

```bash uv
uv add "xata==1.0.0a7"
```
</CodeGroup>

## Vector Store

See a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/vectorstores/xata).

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import XataVectorStore
```
