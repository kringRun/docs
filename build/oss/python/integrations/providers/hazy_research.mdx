title: Hazy Research
---

This page covers how to use the Hazy Research ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific Hazy Research wrappers.

## Installation and Setup
- To use the `manifest`, install it with `pip install manifest-ml`

## Wrappers

### LLM

There exists an LLM wrapper around Hazy Research's `manifest` library.
`manifest` is a python library which is itself a wrapper around many model providers, and adds in caching, history, and more.

To use this wrapper:
```python
from langchain_community.llms.manifest import ManifestWrapper
```
