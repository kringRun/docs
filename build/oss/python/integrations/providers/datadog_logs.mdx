title: Datadog Logs

>[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is a monitoring and analytics platform for cloud-scale applications.

## Installation and Setup

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install datadog_api_client
```

```bash uv
uv add datadog_api_client
```
</CodeGroup>

We must initialize the loader with the Datadog API key and APP key, and we need to set up the query to extract the desired logs.

## Document Loader

See a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/document_loaders/datadog_logs).

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import DatadogLogsLoader
```
