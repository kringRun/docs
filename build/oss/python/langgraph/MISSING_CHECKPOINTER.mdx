<AlphaCallout />

You are attempting to use built-in LangGraph persistence without providing a checkpointer.

This happens when a `checkpointer` is missing in the `compile()` method of [`StateGraph`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/graphs/#langgraph.graph.StateGraph) or [`entrypoint`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/func/#langgraph.func.entrypoint).

## Troubleshooting

The following may help resolve this error:

-   Initialize and pass a checkpointer to the `compile()` method of [`StateGraph`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/graphs/#langgraph.graph.StateGraph) or [`entrypoint`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/func/#langgraph.func.entrypoint).

```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver
checkpointer = InMemorySaver()

# Graph API
graph = StateGraph(...).compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

# Functional API
@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def workflow(messages: list[str]) -> str:
    ...
```





-   Use the LangGraph API so you don't need to implement or configure checkpointers manually. The API handles all persistence infrastructure for you.
