**Make your integration available to the community.**

<Warning>
**Important: New integrations should be standalone packages, not PRs to the LangChain monorepo.**

While LangChain maintains a small subset of first-party and high-usage integrations (like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama) in the main repository, **new integrations should be published as separate PyPI packages and repositories** (e.g., `langchain-yourservice`) that users install alongside the core LangChain packages. You do **not** submit a PR to add your integration directly to the main LangChain repository.
</Warning>

Now that your package is implemented and tested, you can publish it and add documentation to make it discoverable by the community.

### Submitting a PR

Make a fork of the [LangChain docs repository](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs) under a personal GitHub account, and clone it locally. Create a new branch for your integration. Copy the template and modify them using your favorite markdown text editor. Make sure to refer to and follow the [documentation guide](/oss/javascript/contributing/documentation) when writing your documentation.

<Warning>
    We may reject PRs or ask for modification if:
    - CI checks fail
    - Severe grammatical errors or typos are present
    - [Mintlify components](/oss/javascript/contributing/documentation#mintlify-components) are used incorrectly
    - Pages are missing a [frontmatter](/oss/javascript/contributing/documentation#page-structure)
    - [Localization](/oss/javascript/contributing/documentation#localization) is missing (where applicable)
    - [Code examples](/oss/javascript/contributing/documentation#in-code-documentation) do not run or have errors
    - [Quality standards](/oss/javascript/contributing/documentation#quality-standards) are not met
</Warning>

Please be patient as we handle a large volume of PRs. We will review your PR as soon as possible and provide feedback or merge it. **Do not repeatedly tag maintainers about your PR.**
