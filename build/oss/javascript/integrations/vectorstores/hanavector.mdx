title: SAP HANA Cloud Vector Engine
---

[SAP HANA Cloud Vector Engine](https://www.sap.com/events/teched/news-guide/ai.html#article8) is a vector store fully integrated into the `SAP HANA Cloud database`.

## Setup

You'll first need to install either the [`@sap/hana-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/hana-client) or the [`hdb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hdb) package, and the [`@langchain/community`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/community) package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from '/snippets/javascript-integrations/integration-install-tooltip.mdx';

<IntegrationInstallTooltip/>

```bash npm
npm install -S @langchain/community @langchain/core @sap/hana-client
# or
npm install -S @langchain/community @langchain/core hdb
```

You'll also need to have database connection to a HANA Cloud instance.

## Creating an HNSW Vector Index

A vector index can significantly speed up top-k nearest neighbor queries for vectors. Users can create a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) vector index using the `create_hnsw_index` function.

For more information about creating an index at the database level, such as parameters requirement, please refer to the [official documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-vector-engine-guide/create-vector-index-statement-data-definition).

## Advanced filtering

In addition to the basic value-based filtering capabilities, it is possible to use more advanced filtering. The table below shows the available filter operators.

| Operator   | Semantic                                                                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$eq`      | Equality (==)                                                              |
| `$ne`      | Inequality (!=)                                                            |
| `$lt`      | Less than (&lt;)                                                           |
| `$lte`     | Less than or equal (&lt;=)                                                 |
| `$gt`      | Greater than (&gt;)                                                        |
| `$gte`     | Greater than or equal (&gt;=)                                              |
| `$in`      | Contained in a set of given values (in)                                    |
| `$nin`     | Not contained in a set of given values (not in)                            |
| `$between` | Between the range of two boundary values                                   |
| `$like`    | Text equality based on the "LIKE" semantics in SQL (using "%" as wildcard) |
| `$and`     | Logical "and", supporting 2 or more operands                               |
| `$or`      | Logical "or", supporting 2 or more operands                                |
