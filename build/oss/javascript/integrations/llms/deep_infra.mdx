LangChain supports LLMs hosted by [Deep Infra](https://deepinfra.com/) through the `DeepInfra` wrapper.
First, you'll need to install the `@langchain/community` package:

import IntegrationInstallTooltip from '/snippets/javascript-integrations/integration-install-tooltip.mdx';

<IntegrationInstallTooltip/>

```bash npm
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

You'll need to obtain an API key and set it as an environment variable named `DEEPINFRA_API_TOKEN`
(or pass it into the constructor), then call the model as shown below:

import Deepinfra from "/snippets/javascript-integrations/examples/models/llm/deepinfra.mdx";

<Deepinfra />
