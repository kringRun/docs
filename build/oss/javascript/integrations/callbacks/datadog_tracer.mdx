title: Datadog LLM Observability
---

<Warning>
LLM Observability is in public beta, and its API is subject to change.
</Warning>

With [Datadog LLM Observability](https://docs.datadoghq.com/llm_observability/), you can monitor, troubleshoot, and evaluate your LLM-powered applications, such as chatbots. You can investigate the root cause of issues, monitor operational performance, and evaluate the quality, privacy, and safety of your LLM applications.

This is an experimental community implementation, and it is not officially supported by Datadog. It is based on the [Datadog LLM Observability API](https://docs.datadoghq.com/llm_observability/api).
