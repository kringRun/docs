[Document loaders](/oss/javascript/integrations/document_loaders) load data into LangChain's expected format for use-cases such as [retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](/oss/javascript/langchain/rag).

LangChain.js categorizes document loaders in two different ways:

- [File loaders](/oss/javascript/integrations/document_loaders/file_loaders/), which load data into LangChain formats from your local filesystem.
- [Web loaders](/oss/javascript/integrations/document_loaders/web_loaders/), which load data from remote sources.

See the individual pages for more on each category.
