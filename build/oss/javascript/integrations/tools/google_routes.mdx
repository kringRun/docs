title: Google Routes Tool
---

The Google Routes Tool allows your agent to utilize the Google Routes API in order to find a route between
two or more destinations. You can get a route by walk, transit, car, motorcycle and bicycle.

## Setup

You will need to get an API key from [Google here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview)
and [enable the Routes API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/routes.googleapis.com). Then, set your API key
as `process.env.GOOGLE_ROUTES_API_KEY` or pass it in as an `apiKey` constructor argument.

## Usage
