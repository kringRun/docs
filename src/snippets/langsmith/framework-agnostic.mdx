You donâ€™t need to use [LangGraph](/oss/langgraph/overview) to build your app to deploy on the LangSmith Platform. LangSmith's deployable unit is a LangGraph _graph_, but your graph can be a thin adapter around any codebase or framework. This lets you keep your core application logic outside LangGraph while still using LangSmith for [deployment](/langsmith/deployments), scaling, and [observability](/langsmith/observability).
