</Info>

The Debugger is a specialized agent IDE that enables visualization, interaction, and debugging of agentic systems that implement the LangGraph Server API protocol. The Debugger also integrates with tracing, evaluation, and prompt engineering.

## Features

Key features of the Debugger:

* Visualize your graph architecture
* [Run and interact with your agent](/langsmith/use-debugger#run-application)
* [Manage assistants](/langsmith/use-debugger#manage-assistants)
* [Manage threads](/langsmith/use-debugger#manage-threads)
* [Iterate on prompts](/langsmith/observability-debugger)
* [Run experiments over a dataset](/langsmith/observability-debugger#run-experiments-over-a-dataset)
* Manage [long term memory](/oss/concepts/memory)
* Debug agent state via [time travel](/oss/langgraph/use-time-travel)

The Debugger works for graphs that are deployed on [LangSmith Platform](/langsmith/deployment-quickstart) or for graphs that are running locally via the [LangGraph Server](/langsmith/local-server).

The Debugger supports two modes:

### Graph mode

Graph mode exposes the full feature-set of the Debugger and is useful when you would like as many details about the execution of your agent, including the nodes traversed, intermediate states, and LangSmith integrations (such as adding to datasets and playground).

### Chat mode

Chat mode is a simpler UI for iterating on and testing chat-specific agents. It is useful for business users and those who want to test overall agent behavior. Chat mode is only supported for graph's whose state includes or extends [`MessagesState`](/oss/langgraph/use-graph-api#messagesstate).
