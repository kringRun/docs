**LangSmith** extends the [LangGraph](/oss/langgraph/overview) framework for building stateful, multi-agent applications as graphs, which allows you to define control flow, manage persistence, and coordinate interactions across components or agents. LangSmith is framework-agnostic, which means you can deploy and operate agents built with LangGraph or [another framework](/langsmith/autogen-integration).

To get acquainted with LangGraph's key concepts and features, complete the following [LangGraph quickstart](/oss/langgraph/quickstart).

While the OSS framework introduces the core abstractions and execution model, LangSmith adds capabilities including managed infrastructure, [deployment models](/langsmith/deployment-options), [assistants](/langsmith/configuration-cloud), and [double-texting](/langsmith/double-texting) support. These platform-level features support the full lifecycle of LangGraph applications, from development to production at scale.
