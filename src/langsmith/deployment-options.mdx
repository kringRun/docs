   Fully managed model for deployment running in LangChain's cloud. A simple way to deploy and manage your LangGraph Servers. Connect your GitHub repositories to the platform and deploy your LangGraph Servers from the [control plane UI](/langgraph-platform/control-plane#control-plane-ui). The build process (i.e. CI/CD) is managed internally by the platform.

   (Enterprise) Manage the data plane in your own cloud, while LangChain manages the control plane. Build a Docker image using the LangGraph CLI and deploy your LangGraph Server from the control plane UI.

    (Enterprise) Run all components entirely within your own cloud environment. Deploy the full LangSmith platform or standalone instances of a LangGraph Server without the control plane UI.
