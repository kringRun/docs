The **Deployments** section covers two related but distinct concepts in the LangSmith platform:

- [**Agent deployment**](#agent-deployment): how to package, build, and deploy your **graphs and agents** to [LangGraph Server](/langsmith/langgraph-server).
- [**Platform deployment**](#platform-deployment): how to host and manage the **LangSmith Platform** itself (the [control plane](/langsmith/control-plane), [data plane](/langsmith/data-plane), and backing services), which provides the management and [observability](/langsmith/observability) layer for your agents.

These two layers work together: you deploy agents *on top of* a LangSmith Platform deployment.

## Agent deployment

_Agent deployment_ focuses on how to build and deploy your graphs (or agentic workflows) as [LangGraph Servers](/langsmith/langgraph-server).

You’ll learn how to:
- Build and containerize your application.
- Deploy agents via the LangSmith control plane (Cloud, Hybrid, or Self-hosted).
- Manage revisions, configuration, and scaling for each agent deployment.

## Platform deployment

_Platform deployment_ covers how to host and manage the LangSmith Platform itself, including the [control plane](/langsmith/control-plane), [data plane](/langsmith/data-plane), and required services. You’ll choose between three hosting options: [Cloud](/langsmith/cloud), [Hybrid](/langsmith/hybrid), or [Self-hosted](/langsmith/self-hosted), depending on your scale, security, and infrastructure needs.

<Tip>
You can [run a LangGraph Server locally for free](/langsmith/local-server) for testing and development.
