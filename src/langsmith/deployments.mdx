Welcome to LangSmith Deployment. This section covers how to deploy both your agent applications and LangSmith (control plane, data plane, and supporting services) that hosts and monitors them.

This page describes two related but distinct concepts in LangSmith:

- [**Agent deployment**](#agent-deployment): how to package, build, and deploy your **graphs and agents**.
- [**Platform deployment**](#platform-deployment): how to host and manage **LangSmith** itself (the [control plane](/langsmith/control-plane), [data plane](/langsmith/data-plane), and backing services), which provides the management and [observability](/langsmith/observability) layer for your agents.

These two layers work together: you deploy agents *on top of* a LangSmith deployment.

## Agent deployment

_Agent deployment_ focuses on how to build and deploy your graphs (or agentic workflows) as [LangGraph Servers](/langsmith/langgraph-server).

You’ll learn how to:
- Build and containerize your application.
- Deploy agents via the LangSmith control plane (Cloud, Hybrid, or Self-hosted).
- Manage revisions, configuration, and scaling for each agent deployment.

## Platform deployment

_Platform deployment_ covers how to host and manage LangSmith itself, including the [control plane](/langsmith/control-plane), [data plane](/langsmith/data-plane), and required services. You’ll choose between three hosting options: [Cloud](/langsmith/cloud), [Hybrid](/langsmith/hybrid), or [Self-hosted](/langsmith/self-hosted), depending on your scale, security, and infrastructure needs.
