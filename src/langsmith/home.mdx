**LangSmith provides tools for developing, debugging, and deploying LLM applications.**
It helps you trace requests, evaluate outputs, test prompts, and manage deployments in one place. LangSmith is framework agnostic, which means you can use it with or without LangChain's open-source frameworks [`langchain`](https://python.langchain.com) and [`langgraph`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/). You can prototype locally and then move to production with integrated monitoring and evaluation to build more reliable AI systems.
